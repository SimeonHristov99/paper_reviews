    What were the key elements of the approach?
        - detailed solutions
        - various topics covered
    What can you use yourself?
        - could be used as a refresher or all the covered topics
        - could be used for a flashcard system where you are given the question and you have to write the solution

How to play any mental game or A Completeness Theorem for Protocols with Honest Majority
    What did the authors try to accomplish?
        Lengthy paper in which the authors lay out a protocol for simulating the trusted party of an ideal game. That is, if more than half of the players follow the protocol, whatever a player (or a set of players of size less than n/2) knows at any step of the game, he would have also known in an idea execution of the game with a trusted party.
    What were the key elements of the approach?
        Related to cryptography and game theory.
        The knowledge constraints are satisfied in a computational complexity sense. Namely, any player in order to compute anything more than his due share of current state, should perform an exponential-time computation.
    What can you use yourself?
        This is mainly a paper to be used for source of ideas. Not as related to AI.
    What other references do you want to follow?
        None, since not directly related to AI.

Leveraging Local Patch Differences in Multi-Object Scenes for Generative Adversarial Attacks
    What did the authors try to accomplish?
        They successfully fool a multi-class image classification neural network for all labels in an image by misaligning patches in the feature map, produced by the model.
    What were the key elements of the approach?
        The perturbations are imperceivable.
        They use a new loss function.
        They use a generative model.
    What can you use yourself?
        The concept of using generative models to fool object classification models is new and provides room for research.
    What other references do you want to follow?
